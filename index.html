	<h2>Profile</h2>
	<p>While I was a small business owner, I had the opportunity to develop several skillsets. I was responsible for creating teaching and promotional materials, developing the school website, and interviewing and placing students. It was an excellent opportunity to see how all aspects of a business run.</p>
	<p>Now I am seeking a position leveraging my information technology, business, and communication skills. I can work with people & technical equipment, words & pictures, deadlines & data. And I'm ready to work for you.</p>
